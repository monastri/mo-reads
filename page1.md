## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/monastri/new-website-test/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### More Testing

This is a test subtopic for drilling practice, because apparently I do well with that kind of stuff. Here's some Markdown:

```markdown
Notice how all text is in this syntax-highlighted code block. 

This wasn't quite what I expected it to be. Maybe the preview is misleading? Maybe I'm just an idiot? 
# This is a header
## This is another
### This is yet another still

You can't bolden text *like this*, you have to do it **like this**. Apparently single stars also _italicizes_ the text.
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/monastri/new-website-test/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
